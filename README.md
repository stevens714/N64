MetaCritic Scraping Project

This is a CLI application built in Ruby as a part of a portfolio for the Flatiron School Software Engineering curriculum.

This application is based upon reviews found at metacritic.com for the top 71 Nintendo 64 games as rated by metacritic.

Upon starting the application, the user will be prompted to select from four (4) prompts:

1. Review all 71 games;
2. Review all games with a user rating of 8.0 or higher;
3. Review all games with a user rating below 8.0;
4. Exit the program.

A quick side note, should the user incidentally (or purposefully) select anything outside of 1-4, this will trigger the application to run from the beginning.

Each of the base menus for each of the options 1-3 will contain basic data about the game, such as the name of the game, release date, user rating score and metacritic rating score.

If the user selects to move forward, the application will then display three (3) critic reviews and the top user review for their selection.
 
After the completion, the application will thank the user for visiting the application, and will end the process.
